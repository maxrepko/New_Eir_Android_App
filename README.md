# New_Eir_Android_App

NOTE: All I have left from this project is this demo, as I had assumed I would never need it again and deleted it to save storage space, a misstep I will not be making again.

Task: I was tasked with creating an Android app for my senior design team's final project. The project was a device that utilized UV-C to clean the cooling coil of air conditioning systems to reduce the spread of viral infections such as COVID-19, as well as keep the cooling coil mold-free. However, this device had a lot of sensors and we needed a convenient way to be able to display and see said readings.

Action: Creating the application (app) was a completely new experience for me. I had to start from scratch and learn what it was that made an Android application work. After completing several in depth tutorials on the topic of making Android apps. 

Video Explanation: In this video, you can see start by clicking the app icon to open the app. From this point, you see a "REQUEST LATEST DATA" button and nothing else. However, a little later, the button is pressed and a short list appears under the button that is sorted as follows: List Position Number / Date (demo just shows "sample data"/ Reading 1, Reading 2, Reading 3. I click the button a few more times and more, short lists are appended to the bottom of the current one. This was done in order for the user to be able to quickly reference readings if they need to see how the data is changing and be able to compare to older data.
